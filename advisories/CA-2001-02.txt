   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

   Domain Name System (DNS) Servers running various versions of ISC BIND
   (including both 4.9.x prior to 4.9.8 and 8.2.x prior to 8.2.3; 9.x is
   not affected) and derivatives. Because the normal operation of most
   services on the Internet depends on the proper operation of DNS
   servers, other services could be impacted if these vulnerabilities are
   exploited.

Overview

   The CERT/CC has recently learned of four vulnerabilities spanning
   multiple versions of the Internet Software Consortium's (ISC) Berkeley
   Internet Name Domain (BIND) server. BIND is an implementation of the
   Domain Name System (DNS) that is maintained by the ISC. Because the
   majority of name servers in operation today run BIND, these
   vulnerabilities present a serious threat to the Internet
   infrastructure.

   Three of these vulnerabilities (VU#196945, VU#572183, and VU#868916)
   were discovered by the COVERT Labs at PGP Security, who have posted an
   advisory regarding these issues at

          http://www.pgp.com/research/covert/advisories/047.asp

   The fourth vulnerability (VU#325431) was discovered by Claudio
   Musmarra.

   The Internet Software Consortium has posted information about all four
   vulnerabilities at

          http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/bind-security.html

I. Description

   VU#196945 - ISC BIND 8 contains buffer overflow in transaction
   signature (TSIG) handling code

   During the processing of a transaction signature (TSIG), BIND 8 checks
   for the presence of TSIGs that fail to include a valid key. If such a
   TSIG is found, BIND skips normal processing of the request and jumps
   directly to code designed to send an error response. Because the
   error-handling code initializes variables differently than in normal
   processing, it invalidates the assumptions that later function calls
   make about the size of the request buffer.

   Once these assumptions are invalidated, the code that adds a new
   (valid) signature to the responses may overflow the request buffer and
   overwrite adjacent memory on the stack or the heap. When combined with
   other buffer overflow exploitation techniques, an attacker can gain
   unauthorized privileged access to the system, allowing the execution
   of arbitrary code. 

   VU#572183 - ISC BIND 4 contains buffer overflow in nslookupComplain()

   The vulnerable buffer is a locally defined character array used to
   build an error message intended for syslog. Attackers attempting to
   exploit this vulnerability could do so by sending a specially
   formatted DNS query to affected BIND 4 servers. If properly
   constructed, this query could be used to disrupt the normal operation
   of the DNS server process, resulting in either denial of service or
   the execution of arbitrary code. 

   VU#868916 - ISC BIND 4 contains input validation error in
   nslookupComplain()

   The vulnerable buffer is a locally defined character array used to
   build an error message intended for syslog. Attackers attempting to
   exploit this vulnerability could do so by sending a specially
   formatted DNS query to affected BIND 4 servers. If properly
   constructed, this query could be used to disrupt the normal operation
   of the DNS server process, resulting in the execution of arbitrary
   code.

   This vulnerability was patched by the ISC in an earlier version of
   BIND 4, most likely BIND 4.9.5-P1. However, there is strong evidence
   to suggest that some third party vendors who redistribute BIND 4 have
   not included these changes in their BIND packages. Therefore, the
   CERT/CC recommends that all users of BIND 4 or its derivatives base
   their distributions on BIND 4.9.8. 

   VU#325431 - Queries to ISC BIND servers may disclose environment
   variables

   This vulnerability is an information leak in the query processing code
   of both BIND 4 and BIND 8 that allows a remote attacker to access the
   program stack, possibly exposing program and/or environment variables.
   This vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially formatted query
   to vulnerable BIND servers.

II. Impact

   VU#196945 - ISC BIND 8 contains buffer overflow in transaction
   signature (TSIG) handling code

   This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute code with the same
   privileges as the BIND server. Because BIND is typically run by a
   superuser account, the execution would occur with superuser
   privileges. 

   VU#572183 - ISC BIND 4 contains buffer overflow in nslookupComplain()

   This vulnerability can disrupt the proper operation of the BIND server
   and may allow an attacker to execute code with the privileges of the
   BIND server. Because BIND is typically run by a superuser account, the
   execution would occur with superuser privileges. 

   VU#868916 - ISC BIND 4 contains input validation error in
   nslookupComplain()

   This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute code with the
   privileges of the BIND server. Because BIND is typically run by a
   superuser account, the execution would occur with superuser
   privileges. 

   VU#325431 - Queries to ISC BIND servers may disclose environment
   variables

   This vulnerability may allow attackers to read information from the
   program stack, possibly exposing environment variables. In addition,
   the information obtained by exploiting this vulnerability may aid in
   the development of exploits for VU#572183 and VU#868916.

III. History

   Since 1997, the CERT/CC has published twelve documents describing
   vulnerabilities or exploitation of vulnerabilities in BIND with
   information and advice on upgrading and preventing compromises.
   Unfortunately, many system and network administrators still have not
   upgraded their versions of BIND, making them susceptible to a number
   of vulnerabilities. Prior vulnerabilities in BIND have been widely
   exploited by intruders.

   For example, on November 10, 1999, the CERT/CC published CA-1999-14,
   which detailed multiple vulnerabilities in BIND. The CERT/CC continued
   to receive reports of compromises based on those vulnerabilities
   through December 2000. On April 8, 1998, the CERT/CC published
   CA-1998-05; reports of compromises based on the vulnerabilities
   described therein continued through November of 1998.

   The following graph shows the number of incidents reported to the
   CERT/CC regarding BIND NXT record (VU#16532) exploits after the
   publication of CA-1999-14:

       Incidents By Month Involving the BIND NXT Record Vulnerability
                                (VU#16532) 

   Based on this past experience, the CERT/CC expects that intruders will
   quickly begin developing and using intruder tools to compromise
   machines. It is important for IT and security managers to ensure that
   their organizations are properly protected before the expected
   wide-spread exploitation happens.

Exploitation

   The vulnerabilities described in VU#196945, VU#572183, and VU#868916
   have been successfully exploited by COVERT Labs in a laboratory
   environment. To the best of our knowledge, no exploits have been
   released to the public.

IV. Solution

Apply a patch from your vendor

   The ISC has released BIND versions 4.9.8 and 8.2.3 to address these
   security issues. The CERT/CC recommends that users of BIND 4.9.x or
   8.2.x upgrade to BIND 4.9.8, BIND 8.2.3, or BIND 9.1.

   Because BIND 4 is no longer actively maintained, the ISC recommends
   that users affected by this vulnerability upgrade to either BIND 8.2.3
   or BIND 9.1. Upgrading to one of these versions will also provide
   functionality enhancements that are not related to security.

   The BIND 4.9.8 and 8.2.3 distributions can be downloaded from

          ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind/src/

   The BIND 9.1 distribution can be downloaded from

          ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/

   Appendix A contains information supplied by ISC and distributors of
   BIND. Depending on your local processes, procedures, and expertise,
   you may wish to obtain updates from the ISC or from an operating
   system vendor who redistributes BIND.

Use Strong Cryptography to Authenticate Services

   Services and transactions that rely exclusively on the DNS system for
   authentication are inherently weak. We encourage organizations to use
   strong cryptography to authenicate services and transactions where
   possible. One common use of strong cryptography is the use of SSL in
   authenticating and encrypting electronic commerce transactions over
   the web. In addition to this use, we encourage organizations to use
   SSL, PGP, S/MIME, SSH, and other forms of strong cryptography to
   distribute executable content, secure electronic mail, distribute
   important information, and protect the confidentiality of all kinds of
   data traversing the Internet.

Use Split Horizon DNS to Minimize Impact

   It may also be possible to minimize the impact of the exploitation of
   these vulnerabilities by configuring your DNS environment to separate
   DNS servers used for the public dissemination of information about
   your hosts from the DNS servers used by your internal hosts to connect
   to other hosts on the Internet. Frequently, different security polices
   can be applied to these servers such that even if one server is
   compromised the other server will continue to function normally. Split
   horizon DNS configuration may also have other security benefits.
