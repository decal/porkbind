Topic: BIND - the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

            *** This advisory supersedes CA-96.02. ***

Several vulnerabilities in the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (BIND) have been
fixed in the current version of BIND. One of those vulnerabilities is now
being exploited, a vulnerability that results in cache poisoning (malicious or
misleading data from a remote name server is saved [cached] by another name
server).

The vulnerability has been fixed in BIND version 4.9.6; however, we recommend
upgrading according to our instructions in Section III.B or installing vendor
patches (see Appendix A).  We also urge you to take the additional precautions
described in Section III.C.

We will update this advisory as we receive additional information. Please
check our advisory files regularly for updates that relate to your site.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     The Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (BIND) is an implementation of the
     Domain Name Service (DNS) written primarily for UNIX Systems. BIND
     consists of three parts:

     * The client part. This part contains subroutine libraries used by
       programs that require DNS services. Example clients of these libraries
       are telnet, the X Windows System, and ssh (the secure shell). The
       client part consists of subroutine libraries, header files, and manual
       pages.

     * The server part. This part contains the name server daemon (named) and
       its support program (named-xfer). These programs provide one source of
       the data used for mapping between host names and IP addresses. When
       appropriately configured, these name server daemons can interoperate
       across a network (the Internet for example) to provide the mapping
       services for that network. The server part consists of the daemon, its
       support programs and scripts, and manual pages.

     * The tools part. This part contains various tools for interrogating
       name servers in a network. They use the client part to extract
       information from those servers. The tools part consists of these
       interrogation tools and manual pages.

     As BIND has matured, several vulnerabilities in the client, server,
     and tools parts have been fixed. Among these is server cache poisoning.
     Cache poisoning occurs when malicious or misleading data received from
     a remote name server is saved (cached) by another name server. This
     "bad" data is then made available to programs that request the cached
     data through the client interface.

     Analysis of recent incidents reported to the CERT Coordination Center
     has shown that the cache poisoning technique is being used to adversely
     affect the mapping between host names and IP addresses. Once this
     mapping has been changed, any information sent between hosts on a
     network may be subjected to inspection, capture, or corruption.

     Although the new BIND distributions do address important security
     problems, not all known problems are fixed. In particular, several
     problems can be fixed only with the use of cryptographic authentication
     techniques. Implementing and deploying this solution is non-trivial;
     work on this task is currently underway within the Internet community.

II.  Impact

     The mapping between host names and IP addresses may be changed. As
     a result, attackers can inspect, capture, or corrupt the information
     exchanged between hosts on a network.

III. Solution


Install a patch from your vendor or implement the "best practice" workaround
we recommend in Section III.B. In either case, take the extra precautions
described in Section III.C.

     A.  Obtain and install a patch for this problem.

         Information from vendors can be found in Appendix A of this advisory;
         we will update the appendix as we receive more information.


     B.  Until you are able to install the appropriate patch, we recommend
         the following workaround.

         The "best practice" for operating the publicly available BIND
         system can be either:

         * a heterogeneous solution that involves first installing BIND
           release 4.9.6 and then release 8.1.1, or

         * a homogeneous solution that involves installing only BIND release
           8.1.1.

         In the paragraphs below, we describe how to determine which solution
         you should use.

         Note: Although the security posture in BIND version 8.1.1 is
               identical to that of version 4.9.6, version 8.1.1 is the
               version that will continue to undergo changes and improvements,
               hence our selection of its use as the "best practice."

         1. Shared Object Client Subroutine Library

            If your system and its programs rely on the shared object client
            subroutine library that comes with some releases of BIND, probably
            named libresolv.so, then you need the shared object subroutine
            library and other client software from release 4.9.6. (As of
            this writing, BIND version 8 does not yet support the client
            part as a shared object library.) This client software is
            available at

              ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind/src/4.9.6/bind-4.9.6-REL.tar.gz
                MD5 (bind-4.9.6-REL.tar.gz) = 76dd66e920ad0638c8a37545a6531594

            Follow the instructions in the file named INSTALL in the top-level
            directory.

            After installing this client part, install the server and tool
            parts from release 8.1.1. This software is available at

              ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind/src/8.1.1/bind-src.tar.gz
                MD5 (bind-src.tar.gz) = 7487b8d647edba2053edc1cda0c6afd0

            Follow the instructions in the src/INSTALL file. Note that
            this version will install the client libraries and header files
            in a non-standard place, /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include.
            The src/INSTALL file describes what is being installed and
            where.

            When you install release 4.9.6 first, its client, server, and
            tools parts will be installed in the production locations. When
            you then install release 8.1.1, the server and tools parts will be
            overwritten by that release's versions, but the 4.9.6 client part
            will not.

         2. No Shared Object Client Subroutine Library

            If you do not need the shared object client subroutine library,
            then you need only upgrade to release 8.1.1. This software is
            available at

              ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind/src/8.1.1/bind-src.tar.gz
                MD5 (bind-src.tar.gz) = 7487b8d647edba2053edc1cda0c6afd0

            Follow the instructions in src/INSTALL. Note that the client
            subroutine library and header files are installed in
            /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include respectively. To use
            these when building other systems, you will need to refer to
            their installed locations.


        Note: ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind/src/ is mirrored in
              Germany at ftp://ftp.cert.dfn.de/pub/tools/net/bind/src/

        As new versions of BIND are released in the future, you will be able
        to find them at these sites, as well as other mirrors. You can also
        check ftp://info.cert.org/pub/latest_sw_versions/ for version
        information.


     C. Take additional precautions.

        As good security practice in general, filter at a router all
        name-based authentication services so that you do not rely on DNS
        information for authentication. This includes the services rlogin, rsh
        (rcp), xhost, NFS, and any other locally installed services that
        provide trust based on domain name information.
