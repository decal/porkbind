CERT Advisory CA-99-14 Multiple Vulnerabilities in BIND

   Original release date: November 10, 1999
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC
   
   A complete revision history is at the end of this file.
   
Systems Affected

     * Systems running various versions of BIND
       
I. Description

   Six vulnerabilities have been found in BIND, the popular domain name
   server from the Internet Software Consortium (ISC). One of these
   vulnerabilities may allow remote intruders to gain privileged access
   to name servers.
   
Vulnerability #1: the "nxt bug"

   Some versions of BIND fail to properly validate NXT records. This
   improper validation could allow an intruder to overflow a buffer and
   execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the name server.
   
   NXT record support was introduced in BIND version 8.2. Prior versions
   of BIND, including 4.x, are not vulnerable to this problem. The
   ISC-supplied version of BIND corrected this problem in version 8.2.2.
   
Vulnerability #2: the "sig bug"

   This vulnerability involves a failure to properly validate SIG
   records, allowing a remote intruder to crash named; see the impact
   section for additional details.
   
   SIG record support is found in multiple versions of BIND, including
   4.9.5 through 8.x.
   
Vulnerability #3: the "so_linger bug"

   By intentionally violating the expected protocols for closing a TCP
   session, remote intruders can cause named to pause for periods up to
   120 seconds.
   
Vulnerability #4: the "fdmax bug"

   Remote intruders can consume more file descriptors than BIND can
   properly manage, causing named to crash.
   
Vulnerability #5: the "maxdname bug"

   Improper handling of certain data copied from the network could allow
   a remote intruder to disrupt the normal operation of your name server,
   possibly including a crash.
   
Vulnerability #6: the "naptr bug"

   Some versions of BIND fail to validate zone information loaded from
   disk files. In environments with unusual combinations of permissions
   and protections, this could allow an intruder to crash named.
   
Other recent BIND-related vulnerabilities

   AusCERT recently published a report describing denial-of-service
   attacks against name servers. These attacks are unrelated to the
   issues described in this advisory. For information on the
   denial-of-service attacks described by AusCERT, please see AusCERT
   Alert AL-1999.004 available at:
   
   ftp://ftp.auscert.org.au/pub/auscert/advisory/AL-1999.004.dns_dos
          
II. Impact

Vulnerability #1

   By exploiting this vulnerability, remote intruders can execute
   arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running named,
   typically root.
   
Vulnerabilities #2, #4, and #5

   By exploiting these vulnerabilities, remote intruders can disrupt the
   normal operation of your name server, possibly causing a crash.
   
Vulnerability #3

   By periodically exercising this vulnerability, remote intruders can
   disrupt the ability of your name server to respond to legitimate
   queries. By intermittently exercising this vulnerability, intruders
   can seriously degrade the performance of your name server.
   
Vulnerability #6

   Local intruders who gain write access to your zone files can cause
   named to crash.
   
III. Solution

Apply a patch from your vendor or update to a later version of BIND

   Many operating system vendors distribute BIND with their operating
   system. Depending on your support procedures, arrangements, and
   contracts, you may wish to obtain BIND from your operating system
   vendor rather than directly from ISC.
   
   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
   We will update the appendix as we receive more information. If you do
   not see your vendor's name, the CERT/CC did not hear from that vendor.
   Please contact your vendor directly.

Compaq Computer Corporation

   At the time of writing this document, Compaq is currently
   investigating the potential impact to Compaq's BIND release(s).
   
   As further information becomes available Compaq will provide notice of
   the completion/availability of any necessary patches through AES
   services (DIA, DSNlink FLASH and posted to the Services WEB page) and
   be available from your normal Compaq Services Support channel.
   
Data General

   We are investigating. We will provide an update when our investigation
   is complete.
   
Hewlett-Packard Company

   HP is vulnerable, see the chart in the ISC advisory for details on
   your installed version of BIND. Our fix strategy is under
   investigation, watch for updates to this CERT advisory in the CERT
   archives, or an HP security advisory/bulletin.
   
IBM Corporation

   The bind8 shipped with AIX 4.3.x is vulnerable. We are currently
   working on the following APARs which will be available soon:
