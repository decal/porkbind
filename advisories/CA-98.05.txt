Topic: Multiple Vulnerabilities in BIND
        1. Inverse Query Buffer Overrun in BIND 4.9 and BIND 8 Releases
        2. Denial-of-Service Vulnerabilities in BIND 4.9 and BIND 8 Releases
        3. Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in BIND 8 Releases

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     This advisory describes three distinct problems in BIND. Topic 1
     describes a vulnerability that may allow a remote intruder to gain root
     access on your name server or to disrupt normal operation of your name
     server. Topics 2 and 3 deal with vulnerabilities that can allow an
     intruder to disrupt your name server. Detailed descriptions of each
     problem and its solutions are included in the individual sections on each
     topic.

II.  Impact

     Topic 1: A remote intruder can gain root-level access to your name server.

     Topics 2 and 3: A remote intruder is able to disrupt normal operation of
     your name server.

III. Solution

     All three problems can be fixed by upgrading to the latest version of
     BIND, which may be available from your vendor (see Appendix A of this
     advisory). Questions about the availability of patches from your vendor
     should be directed to your vendor.

     Additionally, the Internet Software Consortium has announced new
     publicly available versions of BIND on the BIND WWW page
     (http://www.isc.org/bind.html) and on the USENET newsgroup
     comp.protocols.dns.bind.

     Additionally, patches are provided for Topics 1 and 3, along with steps
     to take until you can apply the patch or upgrade to the latest version of
     BIND.

*************************************************************************
Topic 1: Inverse Query Buffer Overrun in BIND 4.9 and BIND 8 Releases
*************************************************************************

1.A. Description

     BIND 4.9 releases prior to BIND 4.9.7 and BIND 8 releases prior to 8.1.2
     do not properly bounds check a memory copy when responding to an inverse
     query request. An improperly or maliciously formatted inverse query on a
     TCP stream can crash the server or allow an attacker to gain root
     privileges.

1.B. Determining if your system is vulnerable

     The inverse query feature is disabled by default, so only the systems
     that have been explicitly configured to allow it are vulnerable.

     BIND 8
        Look at the "options" block in the configuration file (typically
        /etc/named.conf). If there is a "fake-iquery yes;" line, then the
        server is vulnerable.

     BIND 4.9
        Look at the "options" lines in the configuration file (typically
        /etc/named.boot). If there is a line containing "fake-iquery", then
        the server is vulnerable.

        In addition, unlike BIND 8, inverse query support can be enabled when
        the server is compiled. Examine conf/options.h in the source. If the
        line #defining INVQ is not commented out, then the server is
        vulnerable.

1.C. What To Do

     To address this problem, you can disable inverse queries, upgrade to BIND
     8.1.2 now that it is available, or apply the patch (see below for more
     information on the patch). We urge you to disable inverse queries until
     you can take one of the other steps.

     Disabling inverse queries
     -------------------------

     BIND 8
        Disable inverse queries by editing named.conf so that either there
        is no "fake-iquery" entry in the "options" block or the entry is
        "fake-iquery no;"

     BIND 4.9
        Disable inverse queries by editing named.boot, removing any
        "fake-iquery" entries on "options" lines. Look at conf/options.h
        in the source. If INVQ has been defined, comment it out and then
        rebuild and reinstall the server.

     Note: Disabling inverse query support can break ancient versions of
           nslookup. If nslookup fails, replace it with a version from any
           BIND 4.9 or BIND 8 distribution.

     Fixing the Inverse Query Code
     -----------------------------

     BIND 8
        Upgrade to BIND 8.1.2 now that it is available
        (http://www.isc.org/new-bind.html) or apply the patch available from:

           ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/Patches/CA-98.05_Topic.1_BIND8_patch.txt

        This file is not PGP signed.  It has the following MD5 checksum:

           MD5 (CA-98.05_Topic.1_BIND8_patch.txt) = 12fc9d395ff987b1aad17a882ccd7840


     BIND 4.9
        Upgrade to BIND 4.9.7 now that it is available
        (http://www.isc.org/new-bind.html) or apply the patch available from:

           ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/Patches/CA-98.05_Topic.1_BIND4.9_patch.txt

        This file is not PGP signed.  It has the following MD5 checksum:

           MD5 (CA-98.05_Topic.1_BIND4.9_patch.txt) = 32da0db1c27e4d484e6fcb7901267c2f


        Notes:

          (1) We are asking sites to retrieve the patches via FTP rather
              than including them in the advisory since our experience is
              that some mail handling systems translate tabs into spaces.
              This prevents the patch(1) program from working properly.

          (2) We have not PGP signed the files since our experience is that
              some implementations of PGP during the extraction process
              will strip spaces from some lines containing whitespace only.
              This may prevent the patch(1) program from working properly.


**************************************************************************
Topic 2: Denial-of-Service Vulnerabilities in BIND 4.9 and BIND 8 Releases
**************************************************************************

2.A. Description

     BIND 4.9 releases prior to BIND 4.9.7 and BIND 8 releases prior to 8.1.2
     do not properly bounds check many memory references in the server and the
     resolver. An improperly or maliciously formatted DNS message can cause
     the server to read from invalid memory locations, yielding garbage record
     data or crashing the server. Many DNS utilities that process DNS messages
     (e.g., dig, nslookup) also fail to do proper bounds checking.

2.B. Determining if your system is vulnerable

     Any system running BIND 4.9 prior to 4.9.7 or BIND 8 prior to 8.1.2 is
     vulnerable.

2.C. What To Do

     There are no workarounds for these problems.

     BIND 8
        Upgrade to BIND 8.1.2 now that it is available.

     BIND 4.9
        Upgrade to BIND 4.9.7 now that it is available.


**************************************************************************
Topic 3: Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in BIND 8 Releases
**************************************************************************

3.A. Description

     Assume that the following self-referential resource record is in the
     cache on a name server:

        foo.example.    IN      A       CNAME   foo.example.

     The actual domain name used does not matter; the important thing is
     that the target of the CNAME is the same name. The record could be in
     the cache either because the server was authoritative for it or
     because the server is recursive and someone asked for it. Once this
     record is in the cache, issuing a zone transfer request using its name
     (e.g., "dig @my_nameserver foo.example. axfr") will cause the server
     to abort().

     Most sites will not contain such a record in their configuration
     files.  However, it is possible for an attacker to engineer such a
     record into the cache of a vulnerable nameserver and thus cause a
     denial of service.

3.B. Determining if your system is vulnerable

     If the BIND 8 server is not recursive and does not fetch glue, then
     the problem can be exploited only if the self-referential resource
     record is in a zone for which the server is authoritative.

     If the global zone transfer ACL in the options block has been set to
     deny access and has no self-referential CNAMEs in its authoritative
     zones, then the server is not vulnerable.

     Otherwise, the server is vulnerable. The nameserver is recursive by
     default, fetches glue by default, and the default global transfer ACL
     allows all hosts; so many BIND 8 servers will be vulnerable to this
     problem.

     (Note: the in.named(8) man page mentions that sending a SIGINT to the
     in.named process will dump the current data base and cache to, by
     default, /var/tmp/named_dump.db. Some sites may find this useful in
     looking for self-referential CNAMEs.  Please see the in.named(8) man
     page for further details.)


3.C. What To Do

     To address this problem, you can apply the workaround described below,
     upgrade to BIND 8.1.2, or apply the patch provided at the end of this
     section. Until you can upgrade or apply the patch, we urge you to use the
     workaround.

     Workaround
     ----------

     First set the global zone transfer ACL to deny access to all hosts by
     adding the following line to the "options" block:

           allow-transfer { none; };

     Next, explicitly authorize zone transfers for each authoritative zone.
     For example, if the server was authoritative for "example", adding

           allow-transfer { any; };

     to the "zone" statement for "example" would allow anyone to transfer
     "example".

     None of the domains for which the server is authoritative should have
     self-referential CNAMEs.

     Fixing the Problem
     ------------------

     Upgrade to BIND 8.1.2, now that it is available, or apply the patch
     available from the following URL to the BIND 8.1.1 source:

       ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/Patches/CA-98.05_Topic.3_BIND8.1.1_patch.txt

        This file is not PGP signed.  It has the following MD5 checksum:

           MD5 (CA-98.05_Topic.3_BIND8.1.1_patch.txt) = 33f9dc2eaf221dd48553f490259c2a8b

        Notes:

          (1) We are asking sites to retrieve the patches via FTP rather
              than including them in the advisory since our experience is
              that some mail handling systems translate tabs into spaces.
              This prevents the patch(1) program from working properly.

          (2) We have not PGP signed the files since our experience is that
              some implementations of PGP during the extraction process
              will strip spaces from some lines containing whitespace only.
              This may prevent the patch(1) program from working properly.

Appendix A - Vendor Information

Below is a list of the vendors who have provided information for this
advisory. We will update this appendix as we receive additional information.
If you do not see your vendor's name, the CERT/CC did not hear from that
vendor. Please contact the vendor directly.


Berkeley Software Design, Inc. (BSDI)
- -------------------------------------

  1.      BSD/OS 3.0/3.1 AS SHIPPED is not vulnerable.
          Sites wishing to enable fake-iquery can install mod
          M310-025, available at http://www.bsdi.com

  2.      BSDI will issue a 3.1 mod when a fix is available.

  3.      BSD/OS is not vulnerable, since we ship bind 4.9.6



Caldera Corporation
- -------------------

Workaround for Topic 1:
        Disable inverse queries by editing named.conf so that either
        there is no "fake-iquery" entry in the "options" block, or
        so that the entry is "fake-iquery no;"

Workaround for Topic 2:

        A workaround is to set the global zone transfer ACL to deny
        access to all hosts by adding the following line to the
        "options" block allow-transfer { none; };
        Next, explicitly authorize zone transfers for each authoritative
        zone.

        For example, if the server was authoritative for "example", adding
        allow-transfer { any; }; to the "zone" statement for "example"
        would allow anyone to transfer "example".

        None of the domains the server is authoritative for should have
        self-referential CNAMEs.

Correction for both Topics:
     The proper solution is to Upgrade to the bind-8.1.1-5 packages.

Digital Equipment Corporation
- -----------------------------

  Digital is investigating this problem.



FreeBSD, Inc.
- -------------

  We ship with INVQ not defined. This makes us resistent against the first
  vulnerability. This is true for all release after 2.2.0 (2.1.* releases
  are vulnerable but should be upgraded anyway).  As we do not yet ship
  BIND 8, we are also not vulnerable to the 3rd vulnerability.

  We advise everyone to upgrade to BIND 4.9.7.

Internet Software Consortium
- ----------------------------

The Internet Software Consortium has announced BIND version 8.1.2 and
BIND version 4.9.7.

If you are running BIND 8.1.1 or 8.1 you want to upgrade to 8.1.2.  If
you are still running BIND-4 rather than BIND-8, you need the security patches
contained in 4.9.7. But, you should really just run BIND-8.

The security fixes included in these releases fix a stack overrun that could
occur if inverse query support was enabled, and a number of denial of service
attacks where malformed packets could cause the server to crash.

Links to the kits are available on at:

        http://www.isc.org/new-bind.html


NEC Corporation
===============

  Topic1 - Some systems are vulnerable.  Patches will be available
           soon, especially for UX/4800 R11.x and R13.x.

  Topic2 - Some systems are vulnerable.  Patches will be available
           soon after the release of bind-4.9.7, especially for
           UX/4800 R11.x and R13.x.

  Topic3 - We do not ship BIND 8 with our products so we are not
           vulnerable to this problem.

  Patches will be available from ftp://ftp.meshnet.or.jp/pub/48pub/security.



The NetBSD Project
- ------------------

  The first problem can be fixed in NetBSD 1.3, 1.3.1, and -current prior
  to 19980408 with the supplied BIND 4.9.6 patch. A patch will be made
  available for the second problem shortly (alternatively, upgrading to
  BIND 4.9.7 or 8.1.2 when available will also solve this problem.)  NetBSD
  is not affected by the third problem.
